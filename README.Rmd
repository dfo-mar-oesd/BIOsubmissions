# BIOsubmissions

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package contains functions to generate data files in various formats to conform to submission standards for
various international data platforms. Currently it contains functions to generate
data files for CCHDO, SDG and OCADS. The package is under development and more functions will be added in the future.
The starting point for all data is assumed to be a BCD format, which is a custom format
used internally at BIO with data from BioChem but can be replicated by pulling data from BioChem
with the SQL query in the `BCD_query.sql` file in the `inst` directory.

## Installation

You can install the development version of BIOsubmissions like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("eogrady21/BIOsubmissions")
```
